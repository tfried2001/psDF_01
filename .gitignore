# git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~

# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# PyInstaller generated files (unique every time project is installed)
*.manifest
*.spec

# Local History VSCode Extension
.history/


# Useful Powershell line for removing cached files that hadn't yet been added to ignore
# git ls-files -c '*/__pycache__/*' | %{git rm --cached $_}
